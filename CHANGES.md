Good afternoon team,
This is Thummala challa bhardvaj .First of all thanks for the oppurtinity at RetainSure.

*********RetainSure Assigment*****************
-->Firstly I choose "Messy migration" as I understood the problem .Secondly I don't have any hands on experience with flask but I did understood a lot about assingment as I know python and how API endpoints work and how to connect with Sqlite.


## Major Issues Identified
- All logic in a single file `app.py`
- Vulnerable to SQL Injection

  ## Changes Made
- Refactored project into modular structure (routes, models, services)
- Used parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection
- Added basic input validation
- Returned proper JSON responses and HTTP status codes

  ## Assumptions / Trade-offs
- Did not hash passwords to avoid breaking login compatibility
- Kept SQLite for simplicity

  ## With More Time I Would:
- Add password hashing (bcrypt)
- Add token-based auth (JWT)
- Write automated tests
- Add pagination to `/users`


  ## Where I used chatgpt:
- Used for sql Connectivity
- used for structuring the files as I don't Know about Flask.
- Used for some coding "user_routes.py" and "user_models.py".

-->Thanks for the oppurtunity and I strongly believe that I can learn new technologies fastly and adapt to them quickly. Looking forward to hearing back from you.
